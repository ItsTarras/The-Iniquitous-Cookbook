 <h1>Shit I cooked : EGG SOUP - serves 4 food or something idk</h1>
 <p>INGREDIETNES\n</p>
 <p>Shrimp - IDK like a couple dozen</p>
 <p>cornstarch</p>
 <p>Salt - 1 tsp (or 1/2 tsp of MSG)</p>
 <p>White pepper</p>
 <p>Chicken broth (homemade preferable)</p>
 <p>Soy sauce - idk like a tablespoon or smth</p>
 <p>garlic</p>
 <p>spring onion (or scallions if you're WOKE)</p>
 <p>a couple of eggs whisked (or beaten if they're into that kind of thing).</p>
 <p>seasame oil</p>
 <h2>1. Start by defrosting your shrimp. You can do this by soaking it in a colainder placed within a bowl of cold water for around 10 minutes.</h2>
 <h2>2. Create your base broth - if you're making your own, boil some chicken bones and vegetables of your choice - preferably ginger and onion.</h2>
 <h2>3. Skim the broth of the fat from the top during this process every once in a while.</h2>
 <h2>4. While the broth is being prepared, create a cornstarch slurry and whisk it up.</h2>
 <h2>5. Whisk up a couple of eggs into a flask, which will allow it to be poured much easier later.</h2>
 <h2>6. Pluck out the chunks from within the chicken broth - you want it to be a smooth silky soup with a hint of sticky thickness from the cornstarch.</h2>
 <h2>7. Add the seasonings (soy sauce, salt/msg, pepper, garlic) and bring the soup slowly back up to a boil. </h2>
 <h2>8. While stirring with chopsticks (it is important to use chopsticks or the dish will explode), slowly pour the whisked egg into the broth to achieve a ribboney texture.</h2>
 <h2>9. Place the shrimp into the broth, making sure that they all hit their target. The odds are one in a krillion.</h2>
 <h2>10. After around 1 minute, or when the shrimp turn pink, take the soup off the heat. </h2>
 <h2>11. Add in around 1 tablespoon of seasame oil and the spring onion for garnish. </h2>
 <h2>12. Serve the soup to your astonishingly large group of bitches (they all love your cooking). </h2>
